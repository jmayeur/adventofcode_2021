This was just a mostly brute force approach.  I spent a fair amount of time fiddling finding valid velocity ranges, and then trying to filter out potentially errant velocities, but the performance wasn't signifcanlty faster.

Here's a case where I'm going to spend some time looking to the math side of this.  I'm sure there's some nice formulas to help calculate trajectory ranges
