These are my generally brute force approaches to Advent Of Code 2021

In the past I would spend more time on code structure, tests and finish, but as I generally write less code each year, I'm looking more at just the pure fun of completing challenges.

Most years my skills begin to fail me around day 15. Though in this case I tapped out on Day 08 part 2. When I hit a barrier I will definitely try to track down a working solution, pull it appart and see if I can put it back together again. I'm not focused on the speed, just finishing.

New this year - a very basic template generator - ./utils/create_day.js to help me spin up the boilerplate files.

Usage: >node ./utils/create_day.js "<rootfolder>" "<day>"   
Ex: >node ./utils/create_day.js "./" "11"   



Day 12 Notes
- I've added Github's Co-pilot.  So far it's filled the role of - super autocomplete, and something really cool.  When I was trying to parse through and comment the code from ./08/part2/runner.js - it understood the context well enough to help me generate comments about the relationship between the "digits" from the challenge, the segments and super/subsets.  That was really helpful.  Not only did it understand the solution as fast/faster than I did, it allowed me to comment/explain/comprehend the code much faster than I would on my own.  I'm more than sold.
