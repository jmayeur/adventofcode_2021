These are my generally brute force approaches to Advent Of Code 2021

In the past I would spend more time on code structure, tests and finish, but as I generally write less code each year, I'm looking more at just the pure fun of completing challenges.

Most years my skills begin to fail me around day 15. Though in this case I tapped out on Day 08 part 2. When I hit a barrier I will definitely try to track down a working solution, pull it appart and see if I can put it back together again. I'm not focused on the speed, just finishing.

New this year - a very basic template generator - ./utils/create_day.js to help me spin up the boilerplate files.

Usage: >node ./utils/create_day.js "<rootfolder>" "<day>"   
Ex: >node ./utils/create_day.js "./" "11"
