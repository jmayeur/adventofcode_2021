This was an interesting challenge. The structure lends itself to brute-force solutions for smaller mutation sets.  However the scale of they data set grows rapdily and brute-force approachs are no longer practical.


Looking at a sequence like AA, with insertions AA -> B, AB -> B, BB -> A, BA -> A; you can see how quickly the sequence would grow. Here's a few iterations.  After 7 we're at 129 characters.  Looking at the grown, each step grows by `NexStepLength = StepLength + (StepLength - 1)`

```
0:AA  
1:ABA  
2:ABBAA  
3:ABBABAABA  
4:ABBABAABBAABABBAA  
5:ABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAABA  
6:ABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAABBAABABBAABBABAABABBABAABBAABABBAA  
7:ABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAABBAABABBAABBABAABABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAABABBABAABBAABABBAABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAABA  
```

Given this, solving Part 2, requires an approach that doesn't rely on using a string.  To solve this I had to look at what was really happening at each mutation.  Using the example above

AA --> ABA - In this case 2 things happened, 1 `B` was added, and 1 `AA` Pair was lost.
To process the next iteration I need to break out the pairs that were created, 1 `AB` and 1 `BA`.  Let's make a map of our values.  
```  
chars = {A: 2} // There's 2 A to start  
pairs = {AA: 1} // There's 1 AA pair to start  
```
  
After processing one iteration I would now have  
```
chars = {A: 2, B: 1} // 1 B was inserted  
pairs = {AA: 0, AB: 1, BA: 1} // we "used" the AA pair, but created 1 new AB and AB pair  
```

After processing another iteration I would have  
```
chars = {A: 3, B: 2} // we added 1 B and 1 A
pairs = {AA: 1, AB: 1, BA: 1, BB: 1} // used AB, BA, made 1 AB, BB, BA, AA  
```
---skiping ahead---  
After Step 4  
```
chars = { A: 9, B: 8 }  
pairs = { AA: 3, AB: 5, BA: 5, BB: 3 }  
```
After Step 5  
```
chars = { A: 17, B: 16 }  
pairs = { AA: 5, AB: 11, BA: 11, BB: 5 }  
```  
You can see the number of pairs & letters growing quickly, but the dataset size is very manageable.  It turns out the following changes are what happens for each pair mutation
  
Take `AB: 5`, `B: 8` from step 4 above.  If we process/insert the change:  
  
We use up 5 `AB`s in this step  
We add 5 `B`s  
We add 5 `AB`s  
We add 5 `BA`s  

```  
count = pairs.AB  
pairs.AB -= count  
pairs.AB += count  
pairs.BA += count  
  
chars.B += count  
```
  
Gotcha - You can't mutate the "map" your using to build the next iteration
